# TestScores

This is a project exploring the effects of personalized learning (technology) in schools and the effects on student achievement.
Data was collected from the study schools and into the current csv. in respository.

File "Test Scores Example" is the same type of data I had, removing all student and school identifiers. 
File "Test Analysis" is R code with identifiers removed.
